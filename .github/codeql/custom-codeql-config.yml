# Explicitly pull in the TODO queries from the CodeQL built in packs (these are excluded from security-and-quality due to filter on problem.severity recommendation)

#NOTE: This would not work as the filter is applied to the packs/suites that are already excluding problem.severity recommendation.  You would need to do this by pulling in all queries from the pack and using filters or inside a .qls where you have more control.
